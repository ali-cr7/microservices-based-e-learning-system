# Sample configuration showing how to add weight metadata for load balancing

# Add this line to each service's application.properties:
eureka.instance.metadata-map.weight=2

# Different weights for different services:
# subscription-service: weight=2 (more capacity)
# user-service: weight=1 (standard capacity)
# course-service: weight=3 (high capacity for file uploads)
# assessment-service: weight=1 (standard capacity)
